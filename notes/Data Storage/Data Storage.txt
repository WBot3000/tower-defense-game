All large chunks of data are stored as globals with the following naming conventions:
*Words encased in brackets [] indicate where unique values go. Words that aren't encased in these brackets are consistent.


DATA_UNIT_[NAME]
- Contains various metadata for unit instances

DATA_ENEMY_[NAME]
- Contains various metadata for enemy instances

DATA_PURCHASE_[NAME]
- Contains metadata for purchases you can make in the shop
	- Usually a DATA_UNIT_[NAME] and a price
	- Allows different shop variations on the same unit
	
DATA_LEVEL_PATH_[LEVELNAME]_[NUMBER]
- Contains path data for a level
- NUMBER starts at 1, and increases for each path in a level
- Referenced in the spawn data present in DATA_LEVEL_MAIN_[LEVELNAME]

DATA_LEVEL_MAIN_[LEVELNAME]
- Contains level-unique metadata, such as starting defense health, starting money, and spawn data


Things Named Similarly:
The different targeting types are also stored similarly to this. They use:
TARGETING_[TARGETINGTYPE]
I didn't prefix this with DATA like the rest for the time being, as this data also contains a function, and I'm not 100% sure if I want to consider components with functionality as part of this data scheme.

Particles also use something like this, that being:
PARTICLE_[PARTICLENAME]
With the particle system itself being refered to as PARTICLE_SYSTEM. These aren't prefixed with DATA, as these are completely initialized particles, not just data.

Most distance variables on the number of tiles covered (a 64 x 64 square).
These can be converted into pixels through the "tilesize_to_pixels" function in the "conversions" script.
If you see a function, [assume it takes distance as tiles], then does coversions as needed.

Most time variables on number of seconds
These can be converted into frames through the "seconds_to_roomspeed_frames" function in the "conversions" script.
If you see a function, [assume it takes time as seconds], then does coversions as needed.
